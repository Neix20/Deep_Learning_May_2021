# Deep_Learning_May_2021

Deep Learning May 2021 Assignment

## Teammates
1. Tan Xi En (Leader)
2. Lee Hao Jie
3. Yikanin Yit

## Learning Objectives
1. To Familiarize ourselves with PyTorch Library
2. To Classify Fashion Article images using Convolutional Neural Network Models

## Dataset Used
1. Fashion MNIST Dataset (Load From PyTorch TorchVision Datasets)
2. Fashion Product Small Dataset (Load From ![Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small))

## Google Drive Link
![Google Drive Repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SCFhdqIMTEbKVldtK2dzOHchMVCGLxUa?usp=sharing)

## How to Use:
1. There will be three files in the dataset. That is, our group Report, Fashion_MNIST_Model and Download_From_Kaggle.ipynb
2. If you would like to create a new repo from scratch and download dataset from kaggle, please run Download_From_Kaggle.ipynb. You will have to upload your own Kaggle API Json file, otherwise, it is also provided in this repository.
3. If you would like to just train and run the model, please run Fashion_MNIST_Model. Our data analysis, Train Test, Result Analysis and Filter Visualizations are all within the Fashion_MNIST_Model. Please cross reference with our group Report for more clarification.
4. If there are any issues, please click the google drive repository link. The Kaggle Dataset have been fully extracted and fully preprocessed there. All files and models run correctly as intended. (Although there might be slight issues....)
5. If there are any queries, feel free to contact me Tan Xi En over MSTeams.
