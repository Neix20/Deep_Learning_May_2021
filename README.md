# Deep_Learning_May_2021

Deep Learning May 2021 Assignment

## Teammates
1. Tan Xi En (Leader)
2. Lee Hao Jie
3. Yikanin Yit

## Learning Objectives
1. To Familiarize ourselves with PyTorch Library
2. To Classify Fashion Article images using Convolutional Neural Network Models

## Dataset Used
1. Fashion MNIST Dataset (Load From PyTorch TorchVision Datasets)
2. Fashion Product Small Dataset (Load From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small))

## Google Drive Link
[Google Drive Repository](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SCFhdqIMTEbKVldtK2dzOHchMVCGLxUa?usp=sharing)

## Github Repo (For This Assignment):
[Github Repo](https://github.com/Neix20/Deep_Learning_May_2021)


## How to Use:
1. There will be seven files in the dataset. That is:
    * Group1_FinalReport.pdf
    * Group1_FinalReport.docx
    * Fashion_MNIST_Model.ipynb
    * Train_Test_Model.ipynb
    * Model_Result_Analysis.ipynb
    * Visualize_CNN_Filters.ipynb
    * Download_Fashion_Product_Small_Dataset_From_Kaggle.ipynb
3. If you would like to create a new repo from scratch and download dataset from kaggle, please run Download_Fashion_Product_Small_Dataset_From_Kaggle.ipynb. You will have to upload your own Kaggle API Json file, otherwise, it is also provided in this repository.
4. Fashion_MNIST_Model.ipynb is a combination of Train_Test_Model.ipynb, Model_Result_Analysis.ipynb and Visualize_CNN_Filters.ipynb. If you would like to see the complete ipynb from start to scratch, please run Fashion_MNIST_Model. Please cross reference with our group Report for more clarification.
5. If you would like to just train and run the model, please run Train_Test_Model.ipynb. Please create a new folder called Models. It will store the saved model parameters within that folder.
6. If you would like to analyze the three models, please run Model_Result_Analysis.ipynb. Please make sure that Models already have some stored models parameters. If you do not wish to train and test model from scratch, please download the models paramters file from our google drive repository.
7. If you would like to visualize CNN filters, please run Visualize_CNN_Filters.ipynb. Please make sure that Models already have some stored models parameters. If you do not wish to train and test model from scratch, please download the models paramters file from our google drive repository.
8. If there are any issues, please click the google drive repository link. The Kaggle Dataset have been fully extracted and fully preprocessed there. All files and models run correctly as intended. (Although there might be slight issues....)
9. If there are any queries, feel free to contact me Tan Xi En over MSTeams.
